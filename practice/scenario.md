## Introduction

Bob is a 25-year-old young professional with a job in software development. He makes $70,000 a year and lives in Chicago. He is reasonably good at managing expenses, and after contributing to his 401(k), manages to save $500 every month.

He would like to grow his wealth and is tolerant of market ups and downs in the pursuit of that wealth. Bob has a starting capital of $10,000 and can contribute another $500 every month to his investments.

Systematic investing would be a good choice for Bob due to its structured approach, ability to manage risk, and potential to deliver consistent long-term results.
