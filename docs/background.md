# What financial goals do people have?

Through my research, I’ve discovered that people have a wide range of financial goals. Some goals that I have found are listed below:

## 1\. Building an Emergency Fund

#### What/Why?

- An emergency fund is a financial safety net. It’s money that is set aside to cover unexpected expenses, such as car accidents, medical emergencies, home repairs, and more.  
- It is important to have an emergency fund to give yourself some financial security. Having money saved up can also eliminate the need to borrow money or use a credit card to cover costs, avoiding debt. 

#### How?

- To create a solid emergency fund, you should assess your living conditions and financial needs. To understand how much money you need in your emergency fund, start by assessing your financial situation. This includes listing monthly expenses such as rent, utilities, groceries, and more.  
- A good rule of thumb is to put  3-6 month’s worth of living expenses into an emergency fund that is separate from your checking account.

#### Good Practices

- Choosing the right type of account is an important consideration when creating an emergency fund. Generally, a good option would be a high-yield saving account, which can help your emergency fund grow while remaining accessible. Make sure there are no annual fees.  
- Only tap into the fund during a true emergency. Replenish the account if you draw on the funds.  
- Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to ensure consistent savings without forgetting.

## 2\. Debt Repayment

#### What/Why?

- Debt is money that is owed from one party to another. It is used to pay off large purchases that they could not afford under other circumstances. Usually, debt must be paid back with added interest. There are several types of debt, such as credit card debt, student loans, mortgages, and more.  
- A common financial goal people have is to repay debt that they owe. This is important as repaying debt in a timely manner will reduce the amount of interest you’ll have to pay and can improve your credit score.

#### How?

- Firstly, it is important to figure out how much you owe. If you have multiple debts, it is best to focus on paying off one debt at a time.  
- There are several strategies to pay off debt. One strategy is called the debt snowball strategy. This strategy involves focusing on paying off the smallest debt first while making minimum payments to other debts, and once that debt is fully paid off, moving on to the next smallest debt.  
- Another strategy is called the debt avalanche strategy. It is similar to the debt snowball strategy in requiring you to make minimum payments on other debts while prioritizing paying off debts with the highest interest rates.

#### Good Practices

- Focus on one debt at a time  
- Create a debt repayment plan that has a detailed list of all debts, including the amount owed, interest rates, and minimum payments.  
- Create a budget and allocate a portion of your income specifically to pay off debt.  
- Try to negotiate rates to reduce interest rates when borrowing money.  
- Avoid accumulating extra debt while attempting to pay off a large debt.

## 3\. Retirement Savings

#### What/Why?

- A retirement plan is a strategy for long-term saving and investing to set away the money to be financially safe after retiring. These savings allow you to continue your lifestyle through your retirement while you are likely not earning a regular income.   
- There are several key reasons for saving for retirement:  
  - Inflation \-  the cost of living typically increases over time, so your retirement funds must be large enough to account for this.  
  - Healthcare \- healthcare costs increase with age  
  - Lifestyle goals \- save enough money to be able to live the retirement you would   
  - love.

#### How?

- The first step to saving for retirement is knowing your retirement needs. This includes estimating your expenses in retirement, such as housing, healthcare, utilities, and more. Then, set goals, such as the target amount you want to save and the age you want to retire.   
- Next, it is vital to create a retirement account. If your employer offers a retirement savings plan such as a 401(k), sign up and contribute as much as you can. Learn about the plan and how long you would need to stay in it to earn the amount of money you need.  
- Try to find some passive sources of income, such as investments. Invest wisely and create a plan to earn a certain amount of money. Know how your savings or pension plan is invested and ensure to diversify your investments.  
- Put money into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). You can add up to $6,500 a year to an IRA, or even more if you are above the age of 50\. IRAs provide several tax advantages. You have two options when opening an IRA:  
  - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.  
  - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

#### Good Practices

- Monitor your savings. Regularly review and adjust your investments.   
- Create a withdrawal strategy for withdrawing funds in retirement to ensure your savings last throughout your retirement.   
- Start as early as possible and contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.  
- Don't touch your retirement savings. If you withdraw them early, you’ll lose principal and interest and may lose tax benefits.

## 4\. Investing to Build Wealth

#### What/Why?

- Investing for building wealth is a very common financial goal that involves investing in various assets with the goal of generating returns that build your wealth. Unlike saving, which is typically short-term and low risk, investing aims to grow your wealth through higher risk, higher reward assets.   
- Investing is a popular strategy to build wealth due to its potential for growth. Investments such as stocks, real estate, and mutual funds offer high growth potential. It also has the potential for compound growth, with money earned from investing being put back into investments and earning more money.  
- Investments can give you more financial independence as savings held in cash tend to lose value due to inflation while investment can help protect the value of your money. 

#### How?

- There are many strategies to grow your wealth through investments. To start, as with all financial goals, it is necessary to define your goals. Determine whether you want to invest in the short term or long term. Find out what level of risk you are comfortable with.  
- There are many different types of investment, such as:  
  - **Stocks.** Also known as shares/equities, buying a stock means owning a portion of a company. When investing in a stock, you are hoping the price will go up so you can sell it for a profit. However, the risk comes in the fact that the price of the stock could go down, meaning you would lose money.  
  - **Bonds.** Bonds are loans made to an entity, typically a business or government entity. While money is lent, you will get paid for interest. When the bond matures after you’ve held it for the contractually determined time, you get your principal back. Although the rate of return of a bond is lower than a stock, there is a lower risk.  
  - **Mutual Funds.** Mutual funds are a pool of many investors’ money that is invested into a number of companies. There are actively managed mutual funds which have a fund manager who picks what to invest in to beat a designated market index, and passive (index) funds which track a major stock market index such as the S\&P 500\. There is a lower risk as investments are diversified. Money can be made when the value of stocks, bonds, or other securities the fund invests in goes up.   
  - **Options.** When you buy an option, you are purchasing the ability to buy or sell an asset at a certain price at a given time. There are call options, for buying assets, and put options for selling them.   
  - **Certificates of Deposit (CDs).** When you buy a CD, you give the bank a certain amount of money for a predetermined amount of time and earn interest on that money. CDs are a very low-risk investment.  
      
- To properly build wealth through investing, you must develop an investment strategy. It is important to distribute your investments across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to manage risk. Ensure you align your investment strategy with your plan of how much money you want to make and the time period you want to make it within.   
- Ensure you monitor and continually adjust your investment portfolio to ensure it maintains your desired level of risk and follows your investment strategy. 

#### Good Practices

- Start as soon as possible to give your money more time to grow through compounding. Ensure that you make consistent investments to build wealth over time.  
- Diversify your portfolio by spreading investments through different sectors to lower portfolio risk. Avoid concentrating too many investments in a single sector.  
- Focus on long-term goals. Resist the urge to buy and sell based on short-term market fluctuations. Stay emotionally invested and maintain a long-term perspective to make the best decisions for your portfolio.  
- Educate yourself above investing and the stock market to avoid making bad decisions and learn about the financial factors that influence the performance of your investments. Conduct thorough research before investing.  
- Minimize fees associated with investing, such as management fees, trading commissions, and fund expenses. Consider choosing low-cost index funds or ETFs to minimize investment costs and improve net profit. 

## 5\. Saving For a Goal

#### What/Why?

- In order to make a major purchase without putting too much financial strain on yourself, it is important to save money. Whether it’s buying a new car, purchasing a home, saving for college, or any other large expense, it is necessary to save to achieve your goal without incurring debt or financial stress.  
- Saving for a goal ensures that you are financially prepared for when the comes, reducing the need to rely on a loan or credit. This can help you to avoid taking on debt and paying interest on borrowed money. It is necessary to save to achieve your dreams without compromising your financial well-being. 

#### How?

- The first step in accomplishing any financial goal is creating a plan. It is first necessary to clearly define what you are saving for, such as a house, car, vacation, or other large purchase. You need to determine the total amount of money you will need to achieve your goal. This will involve some research to learn about costs associated with the goal, such as taxes, fees, and additional expenses.   
- Create a realistic timeframe for when you want to achieve your goal. This will help you determine how much to save per month. Categorize it into either short-term (generally within 1-2 years), medium-term (3-5 years), or long-term (5+ years). You will base your savings and investment strategy on this.   
- Use this information to create a savings plan. Break down the goal to find out the monthly savings you will need and ensure that you actually deposit the amount each month. Regularly track your progress using a spreadsheet, budgeting app such as Mint, or any other strategy you are comfortable with.   
- Create a different account for each goal. This way, you can divide your resources into accounts based on your savings timeline and the amount needed to achieve each goal. Choose the right account depending on the timeline. You could consider:  
  - **High-Yield Savings Accounts:**  
    - **Interest Earnings:** Consider using a high-yield savings account that offers better interest rates than traditional savings accounts, allowing your money to grow faster.  
    - **Liquidity:** These accounts are ideal for short-term or medium-term goals where you need easy access to your funds.  
  - **Certificates of Deposit (CDs):**  
    - **Fixed Term:** CDs offer a fixed interest rate for a specified term, usually ranging from a few months to several years. They may provide higher interest rates than savings accounts but come with early withdrawal penalties.  
    - Best for Medium-Term Goals: CDs are suitable for goals with a fixed timeframe, where you won’t need access to the funds until the CD matures.  
  - **Investment Accounts:**  
    - **Long-Term Growth:** For long-term goals, consider investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, which may offer higher returns but come with higher risk.  
    - **Risk Consideration:** Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and the timeframe of your goal.  
- You can consider using automatic transfers and deductions that transfer money from a checking account to a savings account on a determined day so you don’t have to make the transfer manually each time. 

#### Good Practices

- Set SMART goals (Smart, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound). Prioritize goals based on urgency and importance. For example, if you are saving for college, it should be focused on.  
- Stay disciplined. Avoid reaching into savings accounts for unrelated expenses. Stick to your savings plan.   
- Regularly review your goals to ensure that they are still achievable. If your financial situation changes, adjust your savings plan accordingly.   
- If you receive a sudden large sum of money, such as from an unexpected bonus or inheritance, allocate a portion of it towards your savings.   
- Be patient. Understand that saving for significant goals takes time. Stay persistent in your efforts.
