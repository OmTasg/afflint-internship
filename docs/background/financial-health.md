## Financial Health of US People

I wanted to know how people are doing financially in the US. Are they saving enough? How much debt are they in? What is their income? These questions led me to explore various reports and studies on the financial well-being of people. All of this information was found on a Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2023 - May 2024.

### Current Financial Situation
#### Overall Financial Well-being
I found that according to the Federal Reserve, near the end of 2023, 72% of adults were at least doing okay financially, meaning they reported either "doing okay" financially (39 percent) or "living comfortably" (33 percent). The rest reported either "just getting by" (19 percent) or "finding it difficult to get by" (9 percent). This was essentially unchanged from 2022 but 6% lower than the recent peak at 78% in 2021.

#### Education Disparities
I found it interesting that the gap in well-being by education decreased slightly in the recent years. Financial well-being is still higher among adults with at least a bachelor's degree (87%) compared to those with less than a high school diploma (48%).

#### Racial and Ethnic Ddifferences
Financial well-being varied across racial and ethnic groups, with 82% of Asian adults, 76% of White adults, 68% of Black adults, and 61% of Hispanic adults reporting that they were doing at least okay financially. While most groups saw slight declines, Black adults experienced a 4-percentage-point increase.

#### Causes of Financial Challenges
Inflation remained the most cited financial challenge in 2023, similar to 2022. Other concerns, including basic living expenses, housing, and employment, were also consistent with the previous year. Concerns about retirement decreased as more people felt their savings were on track.

Many respondents specifically mentioned the rising cost of food and groceries as a significant strain on their budgets, particularly those earning under $100,000.

 Housing affordability was a major concern, especially among renters, younger adults, and those living in the West. The high cost of rent and the difficulty in saving for a down payment were frequently mentioned challenges.
