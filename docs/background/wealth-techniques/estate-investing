## Investing in Real Estate

#### What/Why?

- Real estate investment allows for wealth building through property ownership, income generation, and asset appreciation.
- It provides a tangible asset that often serves as a hedge against inflation.

- Real estate can be leveraged to increase potential returns and offers various tax advantages.

- It is generally more stable compared to other asset classes and allows for risk and reward balancing through diversification.

#### How?

- **Rental Properties:**

  - Purchase residential or commercial properties and rent them out.

  - Manage or outsource property maintenance, tenant management, and rent collection.

  - Leverage rental income to acquire additional properties for expanding your portfolio.

- **Real Estate Investment Groups (REIGs):**

  -  Invest in a REIG, which pools funds from multiple investors to buy and manage rental properties.

  -  Earn income from rental units managed by the group without direct involvement.

  -  Receive returns based on the pooled income, reducing the impact of vacancies.

- **House Flipping:**

  -  Buy undervalued properties with potential for value appreciation.

  - Renovate or improve the properties to increase their market value.

  - Sell the properties within a short timeframe for a profit.

- **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):**

  - Purchase shares in publicly traded REITs that own or finance income-generating real estate.

  - Earn dividends from the profits generated by the REITâ€™s portfolio of properties.

  - Choose between equity REITs (property ownership) and mortgage REITs (real estate financing).

- **Online Real Estate Platforms (Crowdfunding):**

  - Invest through online platforms that pool investor funds for large commercial or residential projects.

  - Diversify your investments across different geographical locations and project types.

  - Be aware of potential illiquidity and management fees associated with these platforms.
