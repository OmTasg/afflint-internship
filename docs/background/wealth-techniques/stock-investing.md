## Investing in Stocks

#### What/Why?

- A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company. Somebody who holds a stock is a partial owner of the company. When the value of the company rises or falls, the value of the stock follows.   
- Stocks are usually bought and sold on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or National Associal of Securities Dealers NASDAQ.  
- Investors buy and sell stocks for a number of reasons:  
  - The potential for the value of their stock to grow over time. Stocks have the potential for high returns, historically outperforming other types of investments.   
  - To profit from short term stock price moves. This can include forms of trading such as day trading  
  - Earn an income by investing in dividend paying stocks. Some companies pay dividends, which are regular payments made to shareholders from the company’s profits. They can provide a steady income stream alongside the potential of the stock’s value going up.   
- There are 3 main types of stocks, each with potential advantages and considerations:  
  - **Common Stock:** A common stock is a stock that represents a share in the ownership of a company. They have potential for higher long-term return. However, you are more likely to lose the investment if the company goes bankrupt.  
  - **Preferred Stock**: A preferred stock is a hybrid investment that has characteristics of both stocks and bonds. They can offer higher yields than many fixed income investments. Share prices experience less volatility compared to common stock. However, there is lower long-term growth potential.   
  - **American Depositary Receipts (ADRs):** ADRs are receipts for shares of the foreign stock issued by US banks.Investors may be able to access financial information more easily for ADRs than for direct investments overseas.

#### How? 

- Before selecting a stock investing technique, there is a bit of information you must figure out. Firstly, it is important to examine your own finances. Although you don’t need much money to start, you shouldn’t invest in stocks until you can afford to do so. If you have debt or other obligations, you should consider putting money towards that before putting it into your investment portfolio.  
- If you are investing merely to build wealth, then you must consider how you wish to do so. This will help you learn your risk tolerance. There are many risks involved in stock investment, and you must be able to take a certain level of risk if you wish to invest. Once you’ve figured out what risk tolerance you have, you can start investing with whatever strategy interests you. These are a few strategies that I found:  
- **Technique 1: Buy and Hold**   
  - **Overview:** This strategy involves purchasing stocks and holding onto them for an extended period, regardless of market fluctuations. This approach is based on the belief that, despite short-term volatility, the stock market tends to increase in value over the long term. This is supported by historical data. By holding stocks for years or even decades, you can benefit from compound growth and dividends.   
  - **How to Implement:**   
    - Choose stocks to invest in wisely. Aim for companies with strong fundamentals, such as solid earnings, good management, and an innovation product.   
    - Diversify investments across various sectors and industries to mitigate risk.   
    - Use money from dividends to purchase more shares, compounding returns.   
  - **Risks**: Market downturns can be stressful for buy-and-hold investors, especially if they panic and sell during a dip. It requires discipline and patience to stick to the plan.  
- **Technique 2: Value Investing**  
  - **Overview:** Value investing is when you look for stocks with prices that you believe don’t reflect the true value of the company. This strategy is grounded in the idea that the market will change to realize the true value of a company, leading to its stock price increasing.   
  - **How to Implement:**  
    - Do research. Analyze the financial statements to assess the value of a company. Look for a low price-to-earning ratio (P/E), high dividend yields, and low price-to-book ratios (P/B).   
    - Thousands of value mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer shares in baskets of stocks thought to be undervalued. For example, the Russell 1000 Value Index is a popular benchmark for value investors, and several mutual funds track this index.  
    - Be patient. Be prepared to wait, as it might take time for the market to correct and recognize the stock’s true value.   
  - **Risks**: Value companies are often hard to find. Value stocks may remain undervalued for longer than anticipated, and some may never reach their expected value, leading to underperformance compared to the broader market.  

- **Technique 3: Systematic Investing**
  - More info [here](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/investment-ideas/systematic-investing)
  - **Overview:** Systematic investing involves following a disciplined, rules-based approach to investing. Instead of relying on emotions or predictions, investors set clear criteria for when to buy, hold, or sell investments, often using algorithms or preset strategies to execute trades. The focus is on long-term consistency rather than market timing.
  - **How to Implement:**
     - Set clear, predefined rules for investment decisions. This could include criteria based on metrics like price-to-earnings ratio, dividend yield, or moving averages.
    - Automate your trading process where possible. Utilize automated tools or algorithms to follow through on your investment strategy consistently without emotional interference.
    - Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes or industries to reduce risk, as systematic investing tends to work better over long periods when applied to a variety of markets.
  - **Risks:** Systematic investing can sometimes lag during volatile markets where flexibility might be required. If the strategy isn’t properly optimized, the mechanical nature of this approach can lead to missed opportunities or exaggerated losses during extreme market conditions.

- **Technique 4: Momentum Investing**  
  - **Overview:** Momentum trading involves finding trends on the market and riding them. The core idea is that stocks that have been performing well will continue to do so in the near future, while those that are underperforming will continue to fall.   
  - **How to Implement:**  
    - Do technical analysis. Use a data-driven approach to look for patterns in stock prices to guide your purchasing decisions. Look for trends in stocks showing strong upwards or downwards trends.  
    - Time your entry/exit well. Use technical analysis to determine the perfect entry and exit points to capitalize on the momentum of the stock and maximize profit.   
    - Make sure to continually monitor your investments as momentum investing requires quick decisions in response to market changes.   
  - **Risks:** Momentum trading carries significant risks due to its reliance on market volatility, where rapid price changes can lead to substantial losses if trades are not timed correctly. Additionally, it requires constant monitoring, as unexpected market shifts can quickly erode profits or increase losses.   

- **Technique 5: Index Investing**  
  - **Overview**: Index investing involves buying shares of index funds or ETFs that track a market index, such as the S\&P 500\. This strategy aims to replicate the performance of the broader market. It provides broad diversification and reduces the risk associated with individual stock picking. Over time, most actively managed funds fail to outperform the market, making index investing a popular choice.  
  - **How to Implement:**  
    - Choose an Index Fund: Select an index fund or ETF that tracks a broad market index, such as the S\&P 500, NASDAQ, or Dow Jones.  
    - Automatic Investment Plans: Set up automatic contributions to consistently invest in the index fund, regardless of market conditions.  
    - Long-Term Holding: Hold the index fund for the long term to benefit from market growth.  
  - **Risks**: Index investing will never outperform the market, as it is designed to match the market’s returns. During market downturns, index funds will experience losses in line with the broader market.  
- There are many other investment strategies, and you should choose one based on your goal.
