## Building an Emergency Fund

#### What/Why?

- An emergency fund is a financial safety net. It’s money that is set aside to cover unexpected expenses, such as car accidents, medical emergencies, home repairs, and more.  
- It is important to have an emergency fund to give yourself some financial security. Having money saved up can also eliminate the need to borrow money or use a credit card to cover costs, avoiding debt. 

#### How?

- To create a solid emergency fund, you should assess your living conditions and financial needs. To understand how much money you need in your emergency fund, start by assessing your financial situation. This includes listing monthly expenses such as rent, utilities, groceries, and more.  
- A good rule of thumb is to put  3-6 month’s worth of living expenses into an emergency fund that is separate from your checking account.

#### Good Practices

- Choosing the right type of account is an important consideration when creating an emergency fund. Generally, a good option would be a high-yield saving account, which can help your emergency fund grow while remaining accessible. Make sure there are no annual fees.  
- Only tap into the fund during a true emergency. Replenish the account if you draw on the funds.  
- Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to ensure consistent savings without forgetting.
