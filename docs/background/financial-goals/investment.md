## Investing to Build Wealth

#### What/Why?

- Investing for building wealth is a very common financial goal that involves investing in various assets with the goal of generating returns that build your wealth. Unlike saving, which is typically short-term and low risk, investing aims to grow your wealth through higher risk, higher reward assets.   
- Investing is a popular strategy to build wealth due to its potential for growth. Investments such as stocks, real estate, and mutual funds offer high growth potential. It also has the potential for compound growth, with money earned from investing being put back into investments and earning more money.  
- Investments can give you more financial independence as savings held in cash tend to lose value due to inflation while investment can help protect the value of your money. 

#### How?

- There are many strategies to grow your wealth through investments. To start, as with all financial goals, it is necessary to define your goals. Determine whether you want to invest in the short term or long term. Find out what level of risk you are comfortable with.  
- There are many different types of investment, such as:  
  - **Stocks.** Also known as shares/equities, buying a stock means owning a portion of a company. When investing in a stock, you are hoping the price will go up so you can sell it for a profit. However, the risk comes in the fact that the price of the stock could go down, meaning you would lose money.  
  - **Bonds.** Bonds are loans made to an entity, typically a business or government entity. While money is lent, you will get paid for interest. When the bond matures after you’ve held it for the contractually determined time, you get your principal back. Although the rate of return of a bond is lower than a stock, there is a lower risk.  
  - **Mutual Funds.** Mutual funds are a pool of many investors’ money that is invested into a number of companies. There are actively managed mutual funds which have a fund manager who picks what to invest in to beat a designated market index, and passive (index) funds which track a major stock market index such as the S\&P 500\. There is a lower risk as investments are diversified. Money can be made when the value of stocks, bonds, or other securities the fund invests in goes up.   
  - **Options.** When you buy an option, you are purchasing the ability to buy or sell an asset at a certain price at a given time. There are call options, for buying assets, and put options for selling them.   
  - **Certificates of Deposit (CDs).** When you buy a CD, you give the bank a certain amount of money for a predetermined amount of time and earn interest on that money. CDs are a very low-risk investment.  
      
- To properly build wealth through investing, you must develop an investment strategy. It is important to distribute your investments across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to manage risk. Ensure you align your investment strategy with your plan of how much money you want to make and the time period you want to make it within.   
- Ensure you monitor and continually adjust your investment portfolio to ensure it maintains your desired level of risk and follows your investment strategy. 

#### Good Practices

- Start as soon as possible to give your money more time to grow through compounding. Ensure that you make consistent investments to build wealth over time.  
- Diversify your portfolio by spreading investments through different sectors to lower portfolio risk. Avoid concentrating too many investments in a single sector.  
- Focus on long-term goals. Resist the urge to buy and sell based on short-term market fluctuations. Stay emotionally invested and maintain a long-term perspective to make the best decisions for your portfolio.  
- Educate yourself above investing and the stock market to avoid making bad decisions and learn about the financial factors that influence the performance of your investments. Conduct thorough research before investing.  
- Minimize fees associated with investing, such as management fees, trading commissions, and fund expenses. Consider choosing low-cost index funds or ETFs to minimize investment costs and improve net profit.
