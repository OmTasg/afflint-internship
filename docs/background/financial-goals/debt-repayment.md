## Debt Repayment

#### What/Why?

- Debt is money that is owed from one party to another. It is used to pay off large purchases that they could not afford under other circumstances. Usually, debt must be paid back with added interest. There are several types of debt, such as credit card debt, student loans, mortgages, and more.  
- A common financial goal people have is to repay debt that they owe. This is important as repaying debt in a timely manner will reduce the amount of interest youâ€™ll have to pay and can improve your credit score.

#### How?

- Firstly, it is important to figure out how much you owe. If you have multiple debts, it is best to focus on paying off one debt at a time.  
- There are several strategies to pay off debt. One strategy is called the debt snowball strategy. This strategy involves focusing on paying off the smallest debt first while making minimum payments to other debts, and once that debt is fully paid off, moving on to the next smallest debt.  
- Another strategy is called the debt avalanche strategy. It is similar to the debt snowball strategy in requiring you to make minimum payments on other debts while prioritizing paying off debts with the highest interest rates.

#### Good Practices

- Focus on one debt at a time  
- Create a debt repayment plan that has a detailed list of all debts, including the amount owed, interest rates, and minimum payments.  
- Create a budget and allocate a portion of your income specifically to pay off debt.  
- Try to negotiate rates to reduce interest rates when borrowing money.  
- Avoid accumulating extra debt while attempting to pay off a large debt.
