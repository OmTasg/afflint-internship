## Retirement Savings

#### What/Why?

- A retirement plan is a strategy for long-term saving and investing to set away the money to be financially safe after retiring. These savings allow you to continue your lifestyle through your retirement while you are likely not earning a regular income.   
- There are several key reasons for saving for retirement:  
  - Inflation \-  the cost of living typically increases over time, so your retirement funds must be large enough to account for this.  
  - Healthcare \- healthcare costs increase with age  
  - Lifestyle goals \- save enough money to be able to live the retirement you would   
  - love.

#### How?

- The first step to saving for retirement is knowing your retirement needs. This includes estimating your expenses in retirement, such as housing, healthcare, utilities, and more. Then, set goals, such as the target amount you want to save and the age you want to retire.   
- Next, it is vital to create a retirement account. If your employer offers a retirement savings plan such as a 401(k), sign up and contribute as much as you can. Learn about the plan and how long you would need to stay in it to earn the amount of money you need.  
- Try to find some passive sources of income, such as investments. Invest wisely and create a plan to earn a certain amount of money. Know how your savings or pension plan is invested and ensure to diversify your investments.  
- Put money into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). You can add up to $6,500 a year to an IRA, or even more if you are above the age of 50\. IRAs provide several tax advantages. You have two options when opening an IRA:  
  - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.  
  - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

#### Good Practices

- Monitor your savings. Regularly review and adjust your investments.   
- Create a withdrawal strategy for withdrawing funds in retirement to ensure your savings last throughout your retirement.   
- Start as early as possible and contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.  
- Don't touch your retirement savings. If you withdraw them early, youâ€™ll lose principal and interest and may lose tax benefits.
