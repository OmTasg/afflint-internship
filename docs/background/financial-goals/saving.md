## Saving For a Goal

#### What/Why?

- In order to make a major purchase without putting too much financial strain on yourself, it is important to save money. Whether it’s buying a new car, purchasing a home, saving for college, or any other large expense, it is necessary to save to achieve your goal without incurring debt or financial stress.  
- Saving for a goal ensures that you are financially prepared for when the comes, reducing the need to rely on a loan or credit. This can help you to avoid taking on debt and paying interest on borrowed money. It is necessary to save to achieve your dreams without compromising your financial well-being. 

#### How?

- The first step in accomplishing any financial goal is creating a plan. It is first necessary to clearly define what you are saving for, such as a house, car, vacation, or other large purchase. You need to determine the total amount of money you will need to achieve your goal. This will involve some research to learn about costs associated with the goal, such as taxes, fees, and additional expenses.   
- Create a realistic timeframe for when you want to achieve your goal. This will help you determine how much to save per month. Categorize it into either short-term (generally within 1-2 years), medium-term (3-5 years), or long-term (5+ years). You will base your savings and investment strategy on this.   
- Use this information to create a savings plan. Break down the goal to find out the monthly savings you will need and ensure that you actually deposit the amount each month. Regularly track your progress using a spreadsheet, budgeting app such as Mint, or any other strategy you are comfortable with.   
- Create a different account for each goal. This way, you can divide your resources into accounts based on your savings timeline and the amount needed to achieve each goal. Choose the right account depending on the timeline. You could consider:  
  - **High-Yield Savings Accounts:**  
    - **Interest Earnings:** Consider using a high-yield savings account that offers better interest rates than traditional savings accounts, allowing your money to grow faster.  
    - **Liquidity:** These accounts are ideal for short-term or medium-term goals where you need easy access to your funds.  
  - **Certificates of Deposit (CDs):**  
    - **Fixed Term:** CDs offer a fixed interest rate for a specified term, usually ranging from a few months to several years. They may provide higher interest rates than savings accounts but come with early withdrawal penalties.  
    - Best for Medium-Term Goals: CDs are suitable for goals with a fixed timeframe, where you won’t need access to the funds until the CD matures.  
  - **Investment Accounts:**  
    - **Long-Term Growth:** For long-term goals, consider investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, which may offer higher returns but come with higher risk.  
    - **Risk Consideration:** Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and the timeframe of your goal.  
- You can consider using automatic transfers and deductions that transfer money from a checking account to a savings account on a determined day so you don’t have to make the transfer manually each time. 

#### Good Practices

- Set SMART goals (Smart, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound). Prioritize goals based on urgency and importance. For example, if you are saving for college, it should be focused on.  
- Stay disciplined. Avoid reaching into savings accounts for unrelated expenses. Stick to your savings plan.   
- Regularly review your goals to ensure that they are still achievable. If your financial situation changes, adjust your savings plan accordingly.   
- If you receive a sudden large sum of money, such as from an unexpected bonus or inheritance, allocate a portion of it towards your savings.   
- Be patient. Understand that saving for significant goals takes time. Stay persistent in your efforts.
